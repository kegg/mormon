      <h2>Can't Say Mormon</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>[April 1990] - Then Elder Russel M. Nelson gives a talk "Thus Shall
          My Church Be Called" emphasizing the full name of the LDS Church, even
          The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</li>
        <li>[October 1990] - President Gordon B. Hinckley states that it's okay
          to use the term Mormon as it means More Good, in a talk titled "Mormon
          Should Mean 'More Good'."</li>
        <li>[2001] - Mormon.org launches.</li>
        <li>[July 2010] - I'm a Mormon Campaign kicks off, where members of the
          LDS church are encouraged to create a profile on Mormon.org titled
          "I'm a Mormon."</li>
        <li>[October 2014] - Mormon Newsroom publishes an article titled
          "Mormonism 101: What is Mormonism?"</li>
        <li>[August 2018] - Now President Russel M. Nelson reaffirms the name of
          the church saying it's been impressed upon his mind to no longer use
          the term Mormon when referring to the church or members of the church
          as it is a victory for Satan.</li>
        <li>[March 2019] - LDS Church changes domain names for mormong.org and
          lds.org to ComeUntoChrist.org and ChurchofJesusChrist.org respectively.
          Changes to mormonnewsroom.org and ldschurchnews.com also undergo changes.</li>
        <li>[January 2020] - LDS Church changes Handbooks 1 and 2, discontinuing
          them and announcing a new handbook which combines both 1 and 2 together
          for all to read. The use of the word Mormon is discontinued in the
          handbook, as well as other wording changes throughout.</li>
