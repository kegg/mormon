  <h1>Inconsistencies</h1>

  <h2>1. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</h2>
  <p>The Doctrine and Covenants (D&C 130) describes the Father the Son, and the Holy Spirit as:</p>
  <blockquote>
    The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also;
    but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Where the Lectures on Faith (5th lecture) says the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing, and
    supreme power over all things-by whom all things were created and made that
    are created and made, whether visible or invisible; whether in heaven, on
    earth, or in the earth, under the earth, or throughout the immensity of space.
    They are the Father and the Son: The Father being a personage of spirit, glory,
    and power, possessing all perfection and fullness. The Son, who was in the
    bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle, made or fashioned like unto
    man, or being in the form and likeness of man-or rather, man was formed after
    his likeness and in his image. He is also the express image and likeness of the
    personage of the Father, possessing all the fullness of the Father, or the same
    fullness with the Father, being begotten of him;

      The publication of the Lectures on Faith in the Doctrine and Covenants
      elevated its status among Church members. In the early 20th century, however,
      Church leaders became increasingly concerned about some of the statements
      in the Lectures on Faith. For example, the fifth lecture speaks of the
      Father as a "personage of spirit," which seems to contradict Joseph Smith's
      teaching (expressed in 1843, several years after the lectures were given)
      that "the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's" (D&C 130:22).
      Elder James E. Talmage, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who
      led the committee that revised the 1921 Doctrine and Covenants, felt that
      it would be best to "avoid confusion and contention on this vital point of
      belief." In addition, the lectures had not been accepted by the Church as
      anything other than theological lessons, Talmage's committee argued. Based
      on these recommendations, the Lectures on Faith were dropped from the
      Doctrine and Covenants. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/lectures-on-faith?lang=eng">https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/lectures-on-faith?lang=eng</a>

    <h2>2. 2015 Doctrine Regarding Children's Baptism</h2>
    <p>Jesus taught the people to not offend His little ones, and encouraged them all to
      come unto Him.</p>
    <p>There are those who would practice unrighteous dominion towards the children of the
      church, and this is wrong. The children of the church must be protected against
      predators within the church. It is sad that such a thought even needs to be brought
      to people's attention, yet it is real.</p>
    <p>Said of children:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"In some minds there seems to be an idea that there should be a different form of
      blessing for children born of non-members and for those who are identified with the
      Church; and it is from such sources that in the case of children belonging to members
      of the Church 'the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob' and all the attendant
      favors are frequently conferred upon the child. This is all wrong. If we take the
      example of our Lord and Redeemer, who is our pattern and whose example we cannot too
      closely follow, we find that He blessed all who were brought to Him. We have no hint
      that He asked whose children they were, or the standing or faith of their parents.
      His remark was, 'Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for of
      such is the Kingdom of Heaven;' and He laid His hands upon them and blessed them. All
      little children, no matter what their parentage may be, are innocent in the sight of
      heaven, and they should be received as such and blessed as such." -George Q Cannon,
      Latter-day Saints'.</p>

    <p>There is also a policy put out by the church in their Handbook 1 for Stake Presidents, Bishops, Mission
    Presidents etc. that will not allow a child who has same sex parents be baptized into
    the church of Christ. They cannot receive a name and a blessing either. Since they cannot be baptized,
    receive a name and a blessing, they cannot go on a mission, or enter the temple to be sealed for time and
    all eternity.</p>

      This was later clarified as being revelation by Russel M. Nelson in a worldwide
      devotional he gave. Becoming True Millennials, January 10, 2016, LDS.org

    Said of the policy change:
    <blockquote>
      <p>The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles counsel together and share all
      the Lord has directed us to understand and to feel individually and collectively.
      And then we watch the Lord move upon the President of the Church to proclaim the
      Lord's will.</p>
      <p>This prophetic process was followed in 2012 with the change in minimum age for
      missionaries and again with the recent additions to the Church’s handbook, consequent
      to the legalization of same-sex marriage in some countries. Filled with compassion
      for all, and especially for the children, we wrestled at length to understand the
      Lord's will in this matter. Ever mindful of God’s plan of salvation and of His hope
      for eternal life for each of His children, we considered countless permutations and
      combinations of possible scenarios that could arise. We met repeatedly in the temple
      in fasting and prayer and sought further direction and inspiration. And then, when
      the Lord inspired His prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, to declare the mind of
      the Lord and the will of the Lord, each of us during that sacred moment felt a
      spiritual confirmation. It was our privilege as Apostles to sustain what had been
      revealed to President Monson. Revelation from the Lord to His servants is a sacred
      process, and so is your privilege of receiving personal revelation.</p>

    <p>When the child turns eighteen years old, and moves out of their parents house, then
    they can be baptized. In effect, they must turn away from their parents and disown
    them.</p>
    <p>This appears to go against the second Article of Faith.</p>
    <p>It should be noted, as of April 4, 2019, the November 2015 policy has been reversed.
    It was stated as revelation to bring it into the handbook, and now it has been
    declared as revelation to be changed. Is God changing His mind regarding what he
    wants for His children?</p>
    <p>To me a change indicates an inconsistency in teachings.</p>
